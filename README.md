Ray Tracing in One Weekend:
    [Ray Tracing in One Weekend.](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

This project is my personal implementation of Ray Tracing in one Weekend, but written in Rust. 

The joy of building a ray tracer, for fun, in rust. This is what got me started on my project.
